# M4OEP-avokey-agpatric-apmazzol
Created by Alex Vokey, Atticus Patrick, and Anthony Mazzola

# Program Summary
The basis of this program was to create a game where the user is a skydiver falling through the air and trying to avoid hitting clouds and getting wet.
You can move left or right with the arrow keys and hit red items that help slow you down. The speed of the game will increase steadily. There is a 5 second "grace period" after losing a life.

# Module 4 Concepts Used
This project uses OpenGL, GLUT, drawing, keyboard listeners, timers, and graphics drawn from class objects.

# Known Bugs
There are no known bugs at the time of submission.

# Future Work
This game could be expanded to have different levels, a scoring system, or many items. It could also be possible to implement mouse listeners into it, but we couldn't find a way that made sense.

# Resources Used
All of this work was created by us or reused from code created for this class.

# Expected Grade
Main program: 40
Keyboard listeners: 20
Timers: 20
Class graphics: 10

Overall: 90
